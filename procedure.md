## Procedure

1. When the page is loaded user will be presented with a 3D simulator representation of IVG on the right frame.
2. Mouse-hover on equivalent circuit to see the equivalent circuit diagram of the simulator model.
3. Mouse-hover on Instructions to know how to perform the experiment.
4. The input parameters namely Charging Voltage(VO),Ground Capacitance (Cg),Tail Capacitance(Cl),Front Inductance(Lf),Load Inductance(Ll), Front Resistance(Rf),Tail Resistance(Rt)are displayed with default values on the other frame.
5. The user can conduct the experiment with the default values,However the parameters can also be changed and the experiment performed.
6. Drag your mouse to see the impulse voltage generator testing apparatus in details. You can also zoom in it by scrolling your mouse for detail study of IVG.
7. After completing detail study of IVG, set the value of voltage and sphere gap
8. Click on start Experiment
9. Then click on open ground switch to give supply to IVG and you can see it in simulator
10. The Charge Capacitor button is to be clicked to charge generator capacitors.Charging time of capacitor is displayed by bar on left corner of simulator
11. The Trigger generator button is to be clicked to display the mechanism of IVG and the fact that Breakdown has occurred or not is displayed.
12. After complete the process the respective graph will be shown. Different alert statements are included to direct the user whether there are withstand or flashover occurs between sphere gaps. View the waveform carefully how waveform is changing with variation in parameters. And also different wave forms are generated for withstand and flashover.
13. Mouse-hover on wave to see the variation of generated voltage with time. You can drag it or Zoom In/Zoom Out the wave form for detail study.
14. Find out Front time and tail time from the wave from (how to find out front time and tail time you have to see theory part).
15. After finding front time and tail time you can compare the generated Impulse wave with standard switching impulse wave.
